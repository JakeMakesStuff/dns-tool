# DNS-Prototype
Prototyping stuff.

## Development/Building
To setup the build/develop environment, you will need to run `npm i` with Node 10+ installed. This will install the dependencies to allow you to build the project.

To start the development environment, simply run `npm run dev`. This will start a development server that will automatically reload the codebase when changes occur.

If you wish to host this on a service, simply run `npm run build`. You can then take the `dist` folder and put it on your web server/bucket. Travis CI does this automatically for this repository.
